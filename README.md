I had a lot of fun working on this challenge. I think that implementing AI to assist with functions and boiler-plate code is brilliant and really allowed me to do something im proud of here within a reasonable amount of time.

i learned a few new techniques and got to see examples of what the correct syntax looks like. 

unfortunately i wasnt able to upload the video files for my websites "portfolio" page but the photos are up there. Ill have to find another way to connect those video files for future projects but they look great on my computer.

i do have the video files if needed, for now the video portolio is functional but empty.
